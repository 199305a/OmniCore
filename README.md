# OmniCore

OmniCore is an Android app for controlling the Omnipod insulin pump (i.e. the "Pod"s).

It implements the full functionality of the PDM (Personal Diabetes Manager). It also allows you to [close the loop](https://openaps.org/) for insulin delivery using your omnipod; currently integrated into a [customized version of Android APS](https://github.com/winemug/AndroidAPS).

The app is currently NOT released.

OmniCore currently does NOT support Omnipod Dash and can be used for Omnipod Eros only. See [roadmap](https://github.com/winemug/OmniCore/wiki/Roadmap).

OmniCore is the follow-up project to [OmniPy](https://github.com/winemug/omnipy)

# Project Status Update - August 31st, 2019

A limited functionality alpha release is in testing for two months now and although the results are technically positive and the issues are mostly trivial, I have identified some architectural weaknesses which need to be fixed before a first release. As I've just returned to work on this, expect more frequent updates, that is until life interferes again.

Next step is a beta release to be announced here, as I believe the alpha testing has met its objective. Still if you'd like to experiment, old alpha builds are located in [Microsoft AppCenter](https://install.appcenter.ms/users/winemug/apps/omnicore/distribution_groups/alpha%20testing)

You can follow the progress more closely [here](https://github.com/winemug/OmniCore/projects/1).

And if you have nothing better to do, [here](https://balya.net)'s where I'll be ranting about life, omnicore and everything.
