# OmniCore

OmniCore is a platform for controlling and automating drug delivery using the Omnipod system.

**Update 03.01.2020:**<br/>
Dear podders

Missed the deadline due some undiscovered issues in the very last minute (Murphy's law) - that sparked a need for a thorough review and in some cases re-write. Since the next release is targeting stability and I am very picky about it, it took several sleepless nights to dissect everything apart to look for potential problems of similar nature.

Now the issues are fixed and consciousness cleared, I can finally write this update. It still requires some time to fit back all the screws, which isn't a lot of work but I can start earliest mid next week (around the 8th).   

My apologies to everyone expecting the release sooner and many thanks to those who have donated to make life bearable. (it absolutely does)

**Update 29.12.2019:**<br/>
Beta v1.0 is scheduled for release in 2019 - so happy new year!

I'm overwhelmed with all kinds of work for the moment, so expect documentation and more information to appear in due time following the release. In the meantime, check out the updated roadmap:
