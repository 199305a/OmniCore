# OmniCore

OmniCore is an Android app for controlling the Omnipod insulin pump (i.e. the "Pod"s).

It implements the full functionality of the PDM (Personal Diabetes Manager).

The app is currently NOT released.

Beta testing will begin on Wednesday, May 29th 2019, available on the [beta](https://github.com/winemug/OmniCore/tree/beta) branch.

First major version and the stable release will be created earliest a week after the first beta release, depending on the results of beta testing.

Note: OmniCore currently does NOT support Omnipod Dash and can be used for Omnipod Eros only. See [roadmap](https://github.com/winemug/OmniCore/wiki/Roadmap).

OmniCore is the follow-up project to [OmniPy](https://github.com/winemug/omnipy)
