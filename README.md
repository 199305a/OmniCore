# OmniCore

OmniCore is a platform for controlling and automating drug delivery using the Omnipod system.

The project is currently in development and a very limited alpha version is available as an app for Android OS.

An incomplete list of features for release v1.0:

- Multiple user profiles and pods
- View and track status of the pods, get alerts & notifications
- View and manage basals, boluses, extended boluses
- Custom bolus and basal patterns
- API for integration of 3rd party apps
